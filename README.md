Off-site Project building a company webpage using flexbox properties

This project was fairly straightforward, I struggled a little bit with the Nav bar and setting that up.

A couple of things:
I decided to not have a seperate 'mission statement' section on the webpage. It didn't look right so I placed this just underneath the company name on the top left to look more appealing.

Creating the 'Our Products' and 'Meet the team' took a little while to get around but pretty straight forward once understanding how to align everything together.

Finally, wasn't in the original remit but I added a contact us page on the bottom with an map and image of the office site just to give it a personalised touch.
